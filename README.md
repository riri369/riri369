## Hi, I'm Aishwarya!

Studying Computer Science at Siksha O Anusandhan<br/>
I come up with great problems but fail with their solutions sometimes WHICH IS WHY I'll always be a learner,
oh well that just makes me a versatile concept artist for solutions -someone else has to actcually build them (sippp~).
